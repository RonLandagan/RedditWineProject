r/wine,Any other winos on a budget?,"Edit 3: *r/proletarianwine is now a thing!* Thank you u/UESfoodie :) 

I‚Äôve noticed a lot of beautiful wine cellars, fancy vintages, etc. in this subreddit. Def wanna be on your level someday, but for now I‚Äôm curious if there are any broke millennials like me who also maintain this hobby? 

I‚Äôm pretty new to wine ‚Äî got into it last summer with the Wine Folly book and a Winc membership. I spend about $60 a month on four bottles or so, plus maybe a treat here and there. We always keep a Bota backup too üòÇ (don‚Äôt @ me y‚Äôall, I earn 35k and a girl‚Äôs gotta drink)

I guess I‚Äôm just curious what folks budget for wine every month, as well as any surprising gems you‚Äôve found in the $15-20ish range. 

My most shocking find was an $8 gewursztraminer from Whole Foods that I will definitely buy again!

ETA: I see I‚Äôve been downvoted and am guessing it‚Äôs from the title? I def meant ‚Äúwino‚Äù as a joke ‚Äî just wanted a catchy phrase, sorry if I‚Äôve caused offense!

Edit 2: Wow, so many replies! Thank you all so much for your recommendations and advice. ‚ù§Ô∏è I‚Äôm glad to know I‚Äôm not the only lowish-income wine enthusiast.

r/wine,How to be pretentious about wine? The perfect answer :D,"Answer by¬†Kalani Tom,¬†Creator of The Wine Code Wine App, Author of¬†The Wine Code¬†wine book, Wine Educator, Wine Consultant

1). When presented with the wine list, reject it and ask for the Captain's list.

2). Browse through the Captain's list with disgust and ask to see the regular wine list again.

3). When the sommelier places the glasses on the table, pick one up and smell it. Mention that it smells like a wet dishcloth and ask for new glasses for everyone.

4). When new glasses are placed, ask if they are the appropriate glasses for the grape you've selected ... ""are these Pinot Noir wine glasses or all-purpose wine glasses?""

5). When the sommelier presents the wine, touch the bottle and insist that it's too warm (or too cold) and ask what temperature the wine has been stored at.

6). Insist the sommelier decants the wine for you, but make sure they decant it ""to the smoke, not the sediment.""

7). After you smell and taste the wine, make sure you say, ""the nose is not reflected on the palate, that's for sure.""

8). After tasting the wine, ask them ""what kind of soil were these grapes grown in?"" Whatever their answer, nod and mention that you can detect that on the palate.

9). Ask them if the wine was bottled on the estate. Wines bottled by the proprietor or (heaven forbid) bottled in cellars are deemed lower quality.

10). Mention to your guests that the wine needs to breathe, but by the time the food arrives, it shall be ready for drinking.",0.97,468.0,0.0,468.0,2020-09-02 06:55:36,il786t,t3

r/wine,Reminder: don‚Äôt be a snob about the bottles people gift you,"Many of us are more knowledgeable about wine than the average person and the people in our lives know this. 

They fret over the bottle they want to give us as a gift with a sense of inferiority about their choice. 

Personally I got into the wine because of the stories behind the grape and the bottle. The best story to tell is how a bottle was a gift from someone that cares about you, especially when you can share that story and bottle with that person. 

Be thankful and humble that someone went through the handwringing and effort to care enough to give you a bottle.

=========================================================================================

**Argentina**:

* Malbecs:
   * San Pedro 9 Lives Malbec Reserve Mendoza Argentina 2017 ($12-14). This is a very bold wine for bold foods. Very intense fruit flavors of berries and cassis with bold tannins that are appropriate for this wine. A great value!
   * Catena Malbec $15
   * Navarro correas
   * Achaval ferrer
   * Zuccardi  are also safe bets.
   * Diseno Malbec
   * Alma Negra M Blend $18

**Australia**:

* Jim Barry The Lodge Hill Dry Riesling $17
* Penfolds Koonunga Hill (Koonunga Hill range is incredibly hit and miss (mostly miss), the only one I would go for is the Shiraz Cabernet, their straight varietals are always underwhelming)
* Chateau Tanunda Grenache, Shiraz and Mourvedre blend
* Shiraz:
   * Barossa Valley Estate Shiraz $14
   * Henry‚Äôs Drive Shiraz $15
   * Laughing Magpie Shiraz $22
   * Yalumba Shiraz $15
   * Wynns Shiraz $13

**Chile**:

* Concha y Toro's Frontera line, they're usually less than $6 and are GREAT for the price
* Concha y Toro Marques De Casa Concha Carmenere D.O. Cachapoal Valley Peumo Vineyard Chile 2016 ($20). A real engaging and delightful carmenere from Chile. An amazing value for the quality, this wine displays a cherry, chocolate nose and flavors with an intriguing note of herbs and black pepper.
* Boya pinot noir

**France**:

* Caves de Bourgueil Lieu-Dit Beaurgeard Bourgueil Cabernet Franc $11 for tasty, juicy, single-vineyard Loire Cab Franc
* Domaine du Rin du Bois' Touraine Rouge gamay
* Muscadet - Pepiere Clos de Briords - $18
* Ch√¢teau Doisy Da√´ne - Sweet White Wine a serious Sauternes under $20
* Beaujolais:
   * Louis Jadot Beaujolais (\~$11 for Villages)
   * Marcel Lapierre Raisins Gaulois Gamay
   * Brouilly or Morgon will be the easiest to find, but pick up a Fleurie or R√©gin√© if you see one for a good price
   * Jean-Paul Brun Terres Dor√©es Beaujolais
   * DuBoeuf Chateau De Saint-Amour Saint Amour 2015 ($24). St. Amour is one of Beaujolais 10 crus or villages that produce from the gamay grape the best and longest lasting wines from Beaujolais. Bright berry/cherry fruit with readily apparent tannins that should smooth out with time. Be patient.
* Cotes du Rhone:
   * Saint Cosme Cotes du Rhone (100% Syrah $15)
   * 2014 Domaine de Ferrand C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne (AKA $20 Chateauneuf-du-Pape)
   * E. Guigal Cote du Rhone (look for the name in a gold oval) $15 one of the best values in wine
* Bordeaux:
   * Chateau Joanin B√©cot Castillon C√¥tes De Bordeaux (75% Merlot 25% Cabernet Franc) $20+
* Burgundy (good values not under $20):
   * Marsannay

   * Nuits-Saint-Georges
   * Pernand-Vergelesses
   * Bouzeron
   * Saint-V√©ran
   * Saint-Bris

**Germany**:

* Dr. Loosen Riesling (sparkling)

* Produttori del Barbaresco's Nebbiolo $25
* Renato Ratti Battaglione Barbera 2016 ($20). Barbera in general is a grape that creates a medium-body, juicy wine that is simple enough to enjoy on its own or paired with equally simple foods, such as pasta. We like this DOCG version for its juicy cherry flavors and spice.
* Vietti Barbera d'Asti $20
* Carpene Malvolti Prosecco: @$12-$15
* Selle e Mosca cannonau di sardegna- Sardinia - a steal at $17.99.
* Poderi Einaudi Dogliani Dolcetto is marvelous. I usually see it for a little above $20.
* Cleto Chiarli Lambrusco $17
* Donelli Lambrusco Grasparossa di Castelvetro Amabile $11

**New Zealand**:

* Sauvignon Blanc:
   * Villa Maria Sauvignon Blanc: $10-$12
   * Astrolabe
   * Villa (Cellar selection and above)
   * Loveblock
   * Hillersden (may be terrible people making this so buyer beware)

   * Zephyr
   * Jules Taylor
   * TWR
   * Kim Crawford
   * Stay away: Misty Cove, Oyster Bay, and HaHa

   * Marques de murrieta
   * Stay away from mass produced (Campo Viejo, C√°ceres, LAN)
* Garnacha:
   * Borsao Tres Picos Garnacha $12 to $15. The basic Borsao is also good and it's $8.
   * Garnacha from Campo de Borja and Calatayud
   * Her√®ncia Alt√©s Garnaxta Negra. $9, 91 points Wine Advocate
* Cava:
   * Conde de Ciralt"" brand at Total Wine... $10 for the Brut or $15 for the Blanc de Blanc.

**South Africa**:

* Chakalaka sub $20 and lights out.
* Raka Biography Shiraz
* Essay chenin Blanc for around 15 is pretty solid
* Kaapzicht Estate Chenin Blanc comes in \~$16 retail and is incredible
* Thokozani SMV Wellington South Africa 2016 ($19.75). This is a very big expressive red wine produced from 85 percent shiraz grapes, 14 percent mourvedre and 1 percent viognier. The wine offers rich ripe complex elements of coffee, chocolate, ripe plum, berries and bacon in a wonderful pleasing wine m√©lange. A very good wine at an amazing price!

r/wine,"UPDATE: Might have just ruined a $60,000 wine collection.","Some may remember, about 4 months ago, I made a post describing how my cooler failed, and heated my cellar up to 113¬∞F / 45¬∞C, and as a result, may have cooked all of my wine.

Just wanted to update those that may have wondered, ""What ever happened to all that wine? ‚Äú

A lot of wine has been put in front of friends and family, a lot of wine has been put in front of the winemakers that made it, in front of colleagues. So far, nobody has been able to tell that anything bad happened. Once I explain the issue, they always tried again, and stuck with their assessment. I mean, if the person that made it says they can't taste the difference, I see no issue.

My observations:
Diam corks for the win! The only issues I found, were cork related. Wines with natural cork, definitely were dried out more than anything else. Natural corks were the only ones that had a little bit of bleed. A few natural wines were the worrisome lots, as they seemed to push the corks a bit, but upon tasting, no issues were observed. Diam corks stayed in place, only dried a little bit, and were the first to stabilize once the temperature and humidity was corrected. In total, I only lost two bottles. They were from the same lot, and was a no sulfite natural white wine. 

Only more time will tell, but in the meantime, we'll keep drinking.

r/wine,Wine jobs in NYC... Help,"I was the bar manager at a successful little restaurant in Williamsburg. I also got my WSET Level 2 certificate. For a couple of years was a food and wine journalist with The Drink Nation and Star Chefs. I also annually (or used to before Covid) attend the portfolio tastings of David Bowler, Skurnik, Jenny &amp; Fran√ßois, and Selection Massale. I‚Äôve decided to pivot my career path into Wine Sales hoping to be a buyer for a decent Natural Wine company in NY within 5 years. I am going into my job search humbly but for the life of me can‚Äôt seem to even land an interview... it would seem my lack of retail sales is being held over me despite, what I believe, to be adequate qualifications for a simple sales position. Anyone here have any similar experiences in the job search? Or at least some tips?

Edit: wow.. I can‚Äôt thank each and every one of you enough. I am seriously moved and touched... some great points were brought up, some great leads and directions pointed to, and some great advice. Know that i will be following up on all your leads and looking into all your advice. It will be a lot of exploration on my part and hitting the proverbial streets-  I‚Äôll keep you all posted too.

r/wine,Rant: Young kids don't care about wine. Stop bringing them to wineries.,"Yeah, I'm ranting a bit here - I apologize in advance for the cranky tone. Had to chase some 6-7 year-olds in the barrel room the other day. I indulged the dad who wanted to see it and thought his gaggle of young kids would give a shit (they didn't, but found it fun to remove bungs from barrels). Lesson learned, never doing that again. Don't know why I was being so nice. Maybe because it was a slow hour.

The week before that, a large family showed up without a reservation (all 15 of them) and was a bit taken aback we couldn't accommodate them for individual tastings, even though we make it clear (from Yelp to the sign) that we require a res for groups of 9 or larger (so we can be staffed appropriately). Their kids were loud, running everywhere, climbing on farming equipment, and being a general OSHA and parenting nightmare, and other guests were clearly annoyed.

Seriously, folks. Very, very few wineries are kid-friendly. Even so-called ""destination"" wineries rarely are equipped to handle kids. Some of those cater to bachelorette parties or frat boys, which is close enough, but still. Even those which have ancillary activities (farm animals, picnic areas) rarely are ideal spots to bring your entire family. There are adults walking or sitting around with wine glasses and who generally come here to enjoy grown-up time.

So hire a sitter, or leave the kids at your parents, or find whatever arrangement you can if you're planning on going wine tasting or visiting a winery. The staff isn't paid to watch your kids. Your tiny ones will get bored, touch things they're not supposed to, annoy other guests, and generally be a nuisance.

I think some people assume all wineries are the same, that just because you can bring the entire gang to V.Sattui, the rest of the wineries out there can provide the same experience. But no.

Now I'm sure there might be a few wineries out there who have grounds where kids are welcome. Seek those out if you insist on taking the kids with you (or if you don't have a choice). Thank you!",0.87,298.0,0.0,298.0,2017-06-12 14:51:26,6gvgjh,t3

r/wine,1949 Chateau Margaux (with tasting notes),"[https://imgur.com/a/H04Gr1z](https://imgur.com/a/H04Gr1z)

The last time I posted a wine review, I provided tasting notes for one of the worst wines I‚Äôve ever put in my mouth: a [1999 Charles Shaw Cabernet.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/el5qkr/1999_charles_shaw_cabernet_sauvignon_tasting/) This review will be a departure from that.

In an incredibly shocking gift from an immensely generous friend of mine, I received about a half bottle of 1949 Chateau Margaux to taste. When looking through his family‚Äôs wine cellar, he decided to open this historic bottle and, after having some of it, decided that he wanted me to try some. I am immensely thankful for this opportunity, as this is the oldest, most prestigious, and most expensive Bordeaux I‚Äôve ever tasted.

Vintage charts don‚Äôt quite go back this far these days, as the wine is 71(!) years old, but it is generally believed that there was a string of post-WWII vintages (1948-52) that were particularly strong. 1949 was characterized by mostly hot and dry weather, which meant the grapes were particularly concentrated in its fruit and its tannins. As a result, this meant the end product was super rich and structured young, and there is opportunity for the wine to have staying power.

The notes I provide are from the second day the wine was opened; my friend shot it with some Argon and also pumped it so it could be as preserved as possible for me.

**Color:** Mostly tawny with slight ruby in the middle of the glass. Surprisingly clear with no presence of sediment.

**Nose:** a whole lot of spice, just a tiny hint of red fruit. Cedar, leather, violet. Beautiful aromatics. I was particularly impressed by how the nose wafted a good 12 inches away from the glass as I stood and observed the color.

**Palate:** smooth as eggs. No surprise that the tannins are completely resolved, so this was a wine that was absurdly easy to drink. There was still just a bit of sweetness on the back end, but most of what I picked up was a balsamic, woodsy, leathery characteristic. It tasted more like an aged Burgundy, what with its spicy notes, than what I usually get from aged Bordeaux (more than likely due to its age). It was super earthy, but there was just a hint of fruit that made it really lovely to think about.

**Finish:** the finish was surprisingly long and bright‚Äîthere was still good acid‚Äîand it lasted for about 15 seconds. Once swallowed, I got a hit of tart cherry fruit that soon left and a smoked, cedary overtone.

&amp;#x200B;

My final take is this: I can‚Äôt believe this wine was this good for 71 years old. Is it the kind of flavor profile I‚Äôd want to drink for the rest of my life? Definitely not‚Äîespecially if I‚Äôm paying a 4-figure price for that experience. Am I thrilled to have experienced this? Absolutely. It may not have been a ‚Äúknock your socks off‚Äù wine, but that isn‚Äôt what tasting is ALL about.  The reason we are all probably devotees of this subreddit is because we love the chance and opportunity to taste history, to celebrate the life (or lack thereof) of something that is historic (Harry Truman was president when this wine was made, for crying out loud), or to experience something we may not get to experience again. All told, I‚Äôm thankful for the experience. I won‚Äôt forget where I was when I tried a ‚Äô49 Margaux for the rest of my life.",0.99,236.0,0.0,236.0,2020-04-21 15:21:12,g5p2kq,t3

r/wine,1982 Lafite-Rothschild.,"Thought I‚Äôd share some stories behind wines tried previously. To start things off, ‚Äò82 Lafite! In my previous life as a corporate and private wine consultant one of my clients was a boat charter company - after building a strong relationship with them, they would go on to refer me unknowingly to what would be my biggest private client. After months of emails and phone calls for wine orders and recommendations for dinners they would have, I got invited over as this persons Housekeeper wanted my opinion on their cellar. I would spend the next few days creating a spreadsheet of everything they had - stuff to drink now, throw out and keep with recommended drinking windows. It was an extensive list that went into the hundreds of items and would take me a month to finish properly with researching bottles. I sent the spreadsheet off and didn‚Äôt hear anything back for a fortnight. Eventually the housekeeper got back to me and couldn‚Äôt believe the data within it, and asked to send an invoice. I replied back it was no charge (they were already spending crazy amounts for dinner parties and gifts). I didn‚Äôt hear anything back for a week and got invited over to theirs again for coffee and lunch - and that‚Äôs when this wine came out. It would be the first of a number of crazy ones I had only ever read about, yet here I was now having them at this persons house. For lunch, it was some ham and salad rolls! The wine of course is what you would expect from such a name and vintage and perfectly cellared - powerful, fresh blue fruit still present with a deep blue jam flavour, graphite and a smoked wood flavour. The finish lasted minutes. Crazy wine.

r/wine,"I'm a sommelier who created a beginning wine course online, and it's FREE this week for our Reddit family until Friday!!","Hey guys! So, I created a series of wine education tools (including this wine course) to help people learn about wine.

Like I mentioned before, offering knowledge on a topic of expertise can look like spam or self-promotion, but the link below is directly to the Udemy website and I am getting ZERO backlinks, ZERO SEO juice and no marketing boost whatsoever, I'm just offering this information for free. 

So, if you're tired of picking out wines because of the cool label, check out my latest wine course below.

Also, if anyone feels this post is going against any policy, please let me know asap as well as any suggestions as to what needs to be changed.

PS. The course is a go-at-your-own-pace type of online learning and you have lifetime access to the class, which means as long as you download it this week for free, you can watch the lectures at your own convenience, next week, next month, next year...whenever.

This course is also geared towards complete beginners, so intermediate/advanced wine peeps will not really benefit.
Mahalo!
